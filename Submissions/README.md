Homework for Module 2 - VBA

In this assignment, we looped through worksheets to find changes in stock values and finding the total stock volume.

Changes are then formatted with a green cell for positive changes and a red cell for negative changes.

This code assumes that dates are formatted in ascending order on each worksheet.
